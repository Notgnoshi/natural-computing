Graduate coursework in Natural Computing

This repository is almost entirely homework, with a slightly improved version of the in-class example of using Simulated Annealing to produce solutions for the Travelling Salesman Problem given [here](examples/tsp_simulated_annealing.py).

Each homework has a corresponding paper that can be built with the included makefile.
